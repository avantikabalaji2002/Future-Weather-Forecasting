# Future Weather Forecasting
Problem Statement: 

The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model for weather forecasting that can provide accurate weather information for the next few days. The model will use historical weather data along with other relevant factors such as wind direction, humidity, and precipitation to predict the weather conditions.

The predicted weather information can be used by various businesses such as transportation, agriculture, tourism, and outdoor events planning to make informed decisions. For example, transportation companies can use weather forecasts to plan their routes and schedules accordingly. Farmers can use weather forecasts to make decisions about planting and harvesting crops. Tourism and outdoor event planners can use weather forecasts to plan their events and activities.

The predictive model will be developed using machine learning techniques such as clustering, classification, collaborative filtering, and market basket analysis. The model will be trained and tested using historical weather data and evaluated based on accuracy and precision. The aim is to develop a model that provides accurate weather forecasts for various regions and can be easily integrated into different applications.
